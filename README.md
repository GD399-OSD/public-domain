Public Domain is a speculative, open repository for cultural knowledge.

This is an open project for Kiel Mutschelknaus' Spring 2018 Graphic Design 4 course at the Maryland Institute College of Art. I'm publishing it under this organization to encourage accountability to keep my design files and processes open.

## Project Overview
The brief is to identify a subculture, conceptualize a business or institution that caters to a need that subculture has, and to create a variable identity system for said business or institution.

I believe subculture is dead (for reasons that I will publish here, eventually) or has morphed into something much different than pre-2007 subcultures. So I chose to pursue a more meta concept: an institution that is intended to map, analyze, and spread existing and dead subcultures.

After a couple weeks of research and internal debate, I settled on __Public Domain__, a library of subculture.


## What's in this repo?
This repository is meant to be a catch-all for my files, thinking, failures, and other design/thought detritus throughout the design process of this project.

Things you can expect to find here:
* Manifestos
* Essays
* Identity Guidelines (print files)
* Logos
* Sketches
* Dumb Things
* Bad Things
* Some Good Things
