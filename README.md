# Public Domain
Public Domain is a speculative, open repository for cultural knowledge.

This is an open project for Kiel Mutschelknaus' Spring 2018 Graphic Design 4 course at the Maryland Institute College of Art. I'm publishing it under this organization to encourage accountability to keep my design files and processes open.

## [Public Domain Design Doc](https://www.figma.com/file/cNGO0OJ05k6uMFeiJoVOB2Kq/Public-Domain)
Feel free to look through the Figma doc above to see my design progress. If you want to contribute to the design side of this project, all are welcome—just let me know and I will invite you to collaborate. 

## Project Overview
The brief is to identify a subculture, conceptualize a business or institution that caters to a need that subculture has, and to create a variable identity system for said business or institution.

I believe subculture is dead (for reasons that I will publish here, eventually) or has morphed into something much different than pre-2007 subcultures. So I chose to pursue a more meta concept: an institution that is intended to map, analyze, and spread existing and dead subcultures.

After a couple weeks of research and internal debate, I settled on __Public Domain__, a library of subculture.

## Are.na Channels
A good portion of my research and thinking is located in two channels on Are.na:
* [Public Domain — Library of Subculture](https://www.are.na/devin-halladay/public-domain-library-of-subculture) — This channel contains research, visuals, and process shots related to Public Domain itself.
* [Public Domain — Library Content](https://www.are.na/devin-halladay/public-domain-library-content) — This channel will eventually contain bits of content collected for the hypothetical library.


## What's in this repo?
This repository is meant to be a catch-all for my files, thinking, failures, and other design/thought detritus throughout the design process of this project.

Things you can expect to find here:
* Manifestos
* Essays
* Identity Guidelines (print files)
* Logos
* Sketches
* Dumb Things
* Bad Things
* Some Good Things
