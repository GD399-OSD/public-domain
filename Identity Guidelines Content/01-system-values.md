# System Values

## Objective

Public Domain is an open repository of knowledge. It is essential that its identity be able to grow and breathe like a library does, and that the boundaries of this identity encourage a user to breach the system when needed.

The objective of this document is to establish, amplify, and continuously subvert the Public Domain identity system in every public-facing communication created by the Public Domain design team.

The contents of this document should be viewed as guidelines and system boundaries, not as categorical rules.
We wish to recognize through our identity that aesthetics are in fact a political artifact, that open design processes are possible, and that everyone should have a say in the way our institutions are shaped.

#### Our Values
1. Openess
2. Freedom
3. Criticality

2. Strip the inessential.
3. Challenge fundamental assumptions.
4. Embrace aesthetic pragmatism.
5. Reject aesthetic “objectivity.”
6. Assert aesthetic freedom.

5. Nothing is prohibited.
